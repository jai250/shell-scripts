游대 1. for Loop (C-style / range-based)
游녤 Fixed Range:
bash
Copy
Edit
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
游늷 Loops from 1 to 5.

游녤 C-style Syntax:
bash
Copy
Edit
for ((i=1; i<=5; i++)); do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
游늷 Like in C/C++, with init; condition; increment.





游대 2. while Loop
游녤 Loops while a condition is true:
bash
Copy
Edit
i=1
while [ $i -le 5 ]; do
  echo "While Loop: $i"
  ((i++))
done



游대 3. until Loop
游녤 Loops until a condition becomes true:
bash
Copy
Edit
i=1
until [ $i -gt 5 ]; do
  echo "Until Loop: $i"
  ((i++))
done
游늷 Runs until i > 5 becomes true.





游대 4. for Loop with Arrays or Strings
bash
Copy
Edit
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")

for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done
Or with a list of strings:

bash
Copy
Edit
for name in Alice Bob Charlie; do
  echo "Hello $name"
done



游대 5. Infinite Loop (with while or for)
丘멆잺 Use with care:
bash
Copy
Edit
while true; do
  echo "This runs forever. Press Ctrl+C to stop."
done
Or:

bash
Copy
Edit
for (( ; ; )); do
  echo "Infinite loop"
done
